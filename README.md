Libcore is the library that includes the core functions of [*lib4console*](https://github.com/lrcno6/lib4console) and *libgui* (unfinished).

It's used to manage a library. You can make an ID for each book and register the lending and returning of all the books intelligently. You can also view unreturned books in chronological order.

It runs everywhere (in theory) (tested on *Windows(cl)* and *linux(g++)*).

### how to use it

Please use [*lib4console*](https://github.com/lrcno6/lib4console) and *libgui* (unfinished).
